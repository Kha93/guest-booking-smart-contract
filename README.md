# GuestBooking Smart Contract

A beginner-friendly smart contract written in Solidity that demonstrates how to store guest information, use mappings and structs, and emit events. Built and tested entirely in [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org), this contract is part of my journey into smart contract development and Ethereum fundamentals.
