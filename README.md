# GuestBooking Smart Contract

This Solidity smart contract allows users (guests) to store their favorite number and name on-chain. Additionally, it supports managing a list of people and retrieving stored data efficiently.

## üõ†Ô∏è Contract Structure

```solidity
struct Person {
    uint256 favNum;
    string name;
}

Person[] public listOfPeople;
mapping(string => uint256) public favNumOf;


## üîß Core Functions

| Function                         | Purpose                                               |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `storeYourFavNumberAsGuest()`    | Temporarily stores a guest's favorite number/name     |
| `retrieveRecentFavNumAsGuest()`  | Retrieves the latest stored guest info                |
| `addPerson()`                    | Adds a person to the public guest list                |
| `getListOfPeople()`              | Returns the full list of all added guests             |
| `favNumOf(name)`                 | Gets a guest‚Äôs favorite number by name (mapping)      |


## Events
- PersonAdded(uint256 favNum, string name)
- GuestFavNumberStored(uint256 favNum, string name)

## üß™ Testing
- You can use Remix IDE for simple testing:
- Open Remix.
- Paste the contract into a new Solidity file.
- Compile with Solidity 0.8.x.
- Deploy using Injected Provider - MetaMask for Sepolia.
- Interact using the Remix UI.
- Advanced testing (e.g., with Hardhat or Foundry) can be added later.
